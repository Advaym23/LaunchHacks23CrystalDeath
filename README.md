## Inspiration
The captivating world of video games, coupled with my passion for interactive storytelling, served as the primary inspiration for me to delve into creating my first Unity game. Witnessing the endless possibilities of game development and the ability to craft unique experiences for players fueled my determination to bring my ideas to life and embark on this exciting journey.

## What it does
My game Crystal Death is about collecting as many gold coins as possible before your health reaches zero. As the player collects a coin another coin appears randomly somewhere else on the island. The controls are A and S for left and right (or arrow keys -> and <-), shift for sprinting,  and the space bar for jumping. The enemy dragon in the sky moves back and forth while dropping crystals of two different colors that deteriorate the health if the character comes in contact (red crystals by 5% and green crystals by 25%).  The health and coin counts are displayed on the top left. Additionally, the ground spikes on the bottom instantly kill the player. Once the health reaches 0, the game ends.

## How we built it
- Unity Engine
- Visual Studio
- C#
  
## Challenges we ran into
Throughout the game development process, I encountered various challenges, including debugging complex code issues and optimizing performance to ensure smooth gameplay on different platforms. Additionally, designing and balancing the game's levels and mechanics demanded meticulous iteration and testing to achieve a cohesive and enjoyable player experience.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
During the development process, I honed my programming skills and gained a deeper understanding of game mechanics, resulting in a polished and engaging gameplay experience.

## What we learned
Working with Visual Studio and C# language in the Unity game engine, I gained proficiency in writing and organizing code, which improved my overall programming skills. Moreover, I learned to effectively utilize Unity's powerful tools and APIs, enabling me to create interactive game elements, implement game mechanics, and develop well-structured projects with ease.

## What's next for Crystal Death
- Adding different levels
- Adding  more enemies and more islands
- Make a leaderboard for the most coins collected
